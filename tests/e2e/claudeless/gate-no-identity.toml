# Claudeless scenario: No agent identity → fails open
#
# When KD_AGENT_ID and KD_ACTOR are not set, gb bus emit --hook=Stop
# should allow (exit 0) rather than blocking. This prevents the gate
# system from breaking sessions that haven't been bootstrapped.

# Run via: tests/e2e/scripts/test-gate-system.sh
