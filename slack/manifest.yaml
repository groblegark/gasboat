# Gasboat Slack App Manifest
#
# Apply this manifest at https://api.slack.com/apps → Your App → App Manifest.
# After editing, reinstall the app to the workspace to pick up new slash commands.
#
# Socket Mode is required — the slack-bridge uses a persistent WebSocket connection
# rather than an HTTP endpoint. No public URL is needed.
